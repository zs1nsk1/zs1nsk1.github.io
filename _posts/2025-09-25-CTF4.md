## CTF Solved: Assessing Web Vulnerabilities and Uncovering Critical Misconfigurations
The Vulnerability Assessment phase focuses on finding existing security flaws and determining if they are exploitable. In this CTF, the target wasn't a service with known public exploits, but rather incorrect configurations and sensitive data exposure on a web server.

This challenge proves that the most powerful tool remains a meticulous scanning and enumeration methodology.

---
### 1. Exposed Version Control Artifacts (Flag 1)
The first hint centered on searching for traces of version control software.

Key Technique: Directory Brute-Forcing (DirBusting).
We used tools like `gobuster` or `dirsearch` with a common wordlist to find hidden or sensitive web directories.

```bash
gobuster dir -u http://192.149.58.3/ -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt
```

The Discovery: The scan revealed the `/.git/` directory was publicly accessible. This is a severe configuration flaw, as it potentially exposes the entire source code history.

The Action: By navigating to the directory, we found the first flag (`flag.txt`), which had been left behind by the developer.

Vulnerability: Sensitive File Exposure due to failure to remove version control metadata in a production environment.

---
### 2. "Loose Security" Data Storage (Flag 2)
The second hint pointed toward a weakness in data storage.

Key Technique: Enumeration of Common Web Services.
Reviewing the initial Nmap scan results (or DirBusting output), we noticed that the MySQL service (Port 3306) was running, and, more importantly, the `phpMyAdmin` administrative interface was accessible.

The Discovery: Accessing `/phpmyadmin/` required no login credentials. This indicates that the administrator had misconfigured the service to allow anonymous or unauthenticated access.

The Action: Inside the `mysql` database, we manually browsed and found a table named `secret_info`, where the second flag was hidden.

Vulnerability: Authentication Bypass on a high-risk database management system.

---
### 3. Sensitive Information in Plain Sight (Flag 3)
The third flag highlighted the danger of debugging files in a production environment.

Key Technique: Standard Configuration File Enumeration.
An Nmap scan using enumeration scripts (`http-enum`) or an exhaustive dirbuster often reveals files that administrators use for debugging or configuration checks.

The Discovery: We found the `/phpinfo.php` file directly accessible via the browser. This file exposes a massive amount of internal server information (PHP versions, environment variables, paths, etc.).

The Action: We searched for the keyword "`flag`" within the file content and found the third flag embedded as a secret server configuration variable.

Vulnerability: Sensitive Information Exposure via carelessly left-behind diagnostic files.

---
### 4. Hunting for Forgotten Sensitive Directories (Flag 4)
The final hint encouraged us to search for directories that, though not indexed, contained critical data.

Key Technique: Deep Directory Enumeration.
We revisited the initial scan results or ran a new dirbuster with a larger wordlist.

The Discovery: We identified a sensitive directory named `/passwords/` which, though obvious by name, was left unprotected.

The Action: Accessing the directory revealed a `flag.txt` file (and likely another file with credentials or internal info), giving us the fourth flag.

Vulnerability: Unintentional Directory Exposure, showing a lack of a "Deny All" policy in the web server configuration.

### Vulnerability Assessment Summary:

This CTF perfectly illustrates that the most common vulnerabilities don't always come from complex coding flaws, but from basic configuration errors and poor server administration hygiene. A proper vulnerability audit must go beyond high-risk exploits and focus on information exposure across the web.
