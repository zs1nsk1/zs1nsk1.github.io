## CTF Assessment Methodologies: The Flag Hunt in Footprinting and Scanning (INE Lab)

Footprinting and Scanning are the bedrock of any ethical hacking exercise. They are our eyes and ears before we take the first step. In this CTF, we applied these methodologies to map the attack surface and uncover crucial information, proving that the biggest treasures are often hidden in plain sight.

Here is the breakdown of the methodology used to capture each flag, highlighting the key tools and techniques.

---
### 1. Initial Discovery and the Hidden Clue in Headers (Flag 1) 
The first step is always port and service scanning. We used Nmap (`-sV -sC -p-`) to get a complete picture of the target.

Key Technique: Service Enumeration with Nmap.

The Insight: The web service (port 80) revealed its identity, and most importantly, the first flag was exposed directly in an HTTP response header! This emphasizes the importance of thoroughly examining the information that servers inadvertently offer us.

Lesson Learned: A misconfigured server can "proudly announce" sensitive information, even within the web response metadata.

---
### 2. Following the "Gatekeeper's" Instructions (Flag 2)
The next Footprinting step is always to look for the digital "gatekeeper's" guide: the `robots.txt` file.

Key Technique: `robots.txt` Analysis.

The Insight: By navigating to `http://[target]/robots.txt`, we discovered directories marked as `Disallow`. One in particular, `/secret-info/`, was highly suspicious.

The Discovery: Accessing that directory led us to a file called `flag.txt`. This proves that many administrators hide directories from search engines but forget that they aren't protected against direct access by an attacker.

---
### 3. The Forgotten Treasure of Anonymous Access (Flag 3)
The hint for this flag pointed us toward services that allow access without credentials.

Key Technique: Reviewing the Nmap Scan and Anonymous FTP Access.

The Insight: By checking our initial Nmap scan, we confirmed that the FTP service was open and allowed anonymous login.

The Action: We connected using the FTP client with the username `anonymous`. Once logged in, we found two crucial files: the `flag.txt` for Flag 3 and, more critically, a file with database credentials (`creds.txt`).

```bash
ftp anonymous@<ip>
```

Lesson Learned: Default configurations or the failure to disable anonymous access on services like FTP is a surprisingly common security oversight.

---
### 4. Connecting to the Revealing Database (Flag 4)
The final step involved using the discovered information to access another critical service.

Key Technique: Credential Reuse Attack (using obtained credentials).

The Insight: The `creds.txt` file contained credentials that, based on the CTF hint, pointed toward the MySQL database. Our initial Nmap scan had already identified port 3306 (MySQL) as open.

The Action: We used the `mysql` client with the recovered credentials (`-u db_admin -p`) to connect. Once inside, a simple command (`SHOW DATABASES;` or enumerating tables/configurations) allowed us to extract the final flag.

```bash
mysql -h <target> -u <username> -p 
show databases; 
```

Lesson Learned: Storing credentials in plaintext in accessible locations or reusing passwords is a direct path to total system compromise.

### Conclusion for Your Blog:

This CTF perfectly illustrates that Footprinting and Scanning aren't just initial steps; they are a complete phase that can lead to compromise without needing complex exploits. Armed with Nmap, `robots.txt`, and a bit of curiosity, we successfully dismantled the initial defenses. A solid reconnaissance methodology is your most powerful weapon.
