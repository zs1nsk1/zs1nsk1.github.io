## CTF - Assessment Methodologies: Information Gathering (INE Lab)
The CTF 1 - Assessment Methodologies: Information Gathering lab from INE (related to the eJPT course) focuses on the initial techniques of Reconnaissance and Information Gathering on a target, which is typically a website (`target.ine.local`).

The objective is to find five "flags" (usually MD5 hashes) hidden in files or configurations of the website.

## Step-by-Step Methodology for Information Gathering (CTF)

### Step 1: Searching for the robots.txt File (Flag 1) ü§ñ
The `robots.txt` file is a public resource web administrators use to instruct search engine crawlers about which parts of the site to avoid. While not a security measure, it often contains "Disallow" paths that reveal directories or files of interest to an attacker.

Action: Navigate directly to the file location in the browser or use `curl`.

Typical Command:

```bash
curl http://target.ine.local/robots.txt
```

Result: The first flag (FLAG1) is often found within this file, hidden in a comment or a disallow line.

---
### Step 2: Service and Version Identification (Flag 2) üõ†Ô∏è
Determining the software and versions running on the web server is crucial for searching known vulnerabilities. The Nmap tool is used for this.

Action: Run an Nmap scan for service and version detection.

Typical Command:

```bash
nmap -sV target.ine.local
# or a more comprehensive version:
nmap -sC -sV target.ine.local
```

-`sV`: Enables service version detection.

-`sC`: Runs default scripts for more detailed enumeration.

Result: The scan output will reveal the type of web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx) and its version, which is where the second flag (FLAG2) is usually hidden.

---

### Step 3: Directory Brute-forcing (Flag 3) üìÇ
Directory scanning searches for unlisted directories and files that may have been forgotten or contain sensitive information.

Action: Use a directory brute-forcing tool like Dirb or Gobuster. Since the web server is often running WordPress, it's helpful to look for common paths on that platform.

Typical Command (Dirb):

```bash
dirb http://target.ine.local
# After finding the directory, you might need to check subdirectories like /wp-content/
```
Result: By examining the paths found (especially a directory like `wp-content/uploads/` on a WordPress site), the third flag (FLAG3) is revealed, often inside a text file or image.

---
### Step 4: Searching for Backup Files (Flag 4) üíæ
Backup files in the web root directory are a very common misconfiguration and a rich source of sensitive information, such as configuration details or credentials.

Action: Use Dirb or Gobuster again, but this time specify common backup file extensions.

Typical Command (Dirb for extensions):


```bash
dirb http://target.ine.local -X .bak,.zip,.tar.gz,.sql
```
Result: A backup configuration file is found, typically `wp-config.bak.` Then, `curl` is used to download or view the content of this file, where the fourth flag (FLAG4) is located.

Example Command: `curl http://target.ine.local/wp-config.bak`

### Step 5: Website Mirroring (Flag 5) üï∏Ô∏è
Some files are not listed or easy to guess but are part of the page's source code and are downloaded when obtaining a complete copy of the site.

Action: Use the HTTrack tool to mirror the entire website locally.

Typical Command:

```bash
httrack http://target.ine.local -O local_site
```

Result: After the download is complete, you navigate the created directory structure (`local_site/`) and use the `grep` tool to search for the flag format (e.g., `FLAG{...}` or the MD5 hash) within all downloaded files. The fifth flag (FLAG5) is often found in a PHP or XML file that was not expected to be viewed directly.

```bash
grep -i "FLAG5" -R target.ine.local/ 
```
